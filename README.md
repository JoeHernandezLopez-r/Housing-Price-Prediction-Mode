Project Title: Housing Price Prediction Mode

- Developed housing price prediction models using various algorithms (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting).

- Employed grid search for hyper parameter optimization. Utilized Python's scikit-learn library with pipelines and grid
search for accuracy.
